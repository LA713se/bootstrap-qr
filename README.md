## My process

After getting an overall view of the application to recreate, I identified what elements I would use for the structure. The biggest challenge was getting to know how to use the Bootstrap tags. I felt more familiar with the tags after ten minutes or so.

### Built with

### What I learned

Learning Bootstrap was very informative, and can help built a site within a smaller timeframe. Exploring the Bootstrap site exposed me to the real depth of the elements in html and attributes of css.

### Continued development

Mastering Bootstrap accelerates my ability to build industry-standard, responsive web applications with professional qualityâ€”saving development time while ensuring scalability, modern integrations, and maintainable code for any project.
